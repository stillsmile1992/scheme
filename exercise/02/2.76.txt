Message-passing cannot equip old data types with new functionality without changing the definitions 
in the existing type - new types are no problem to existing code, as long as they implement all 
functions.

With explicit dispatch every function includes the existing types and only works for them. 
When you add a new type, you have no way of including them in existing procedures without 
changing them.

The lookup table of data directed programming allows for both types and procedures to be added 
quite seamlessly - even both at the same time! No old code has to be changed, even if a new 
function involves an old type or vice versa.


message-passing allows to add new types without changing already written code

explicit dispatch allows to add new operations in the same manner

data-directed approach allows us to add new types with corresponding operations and new operations 
for existing types as well just by adding new entries in the dispatch table
